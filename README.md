Snake game done purely with Python's graphics library Old, Snake games were used as reference for rules, retro-style graphics and controls. 
The Zelle graphics reference was used as guide for most of the methods https://mcsp.wartburg.edu/zelle/python/graphics/graphics.pdf

The game is simple. You control a snake that is constantly moving and have to eat the apples without running into one of the 4 walls or into other parts of the snake itself. 
As you progress, the snake grows, making it harder to avoid. Have fun!
